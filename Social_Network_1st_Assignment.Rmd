# Social Network Analysis - Assignment #1

## Marvel Characters - Partnerships Network

```{r message=FALSE}

library(igraph)
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggraph) # ultimately, might not use it. check at the end
library(tidygraph) # ultimately, might not use it. check at the end
library(ggrepel)
library(extrafont)

```

**1. Choose a network dataset**

Marvel character partnerships, 2018

**2. Indicate the number of nodes should be larger than 300 but smaller than 10000.**

The number of nodes is 350.

```{r}
# (I'm not sure it's necessary)

# Calculate number of nodes
num_nodes <- vcount(marvel_network)

# Clearly reference in the text
cat("Number of nodes:", num_nodes)

```

**3. Import that data and create a graph using R**

## Reading the data

```{r}

marvel_nodes <- read.csv("data/nodes.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, quote = "\"", fill = TRUE)

marvel_links <- read.csv("data/edges.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```

## Data description

Here we should explain what each column and respective values represent.
For instance, 'Group' refers to whether the character is a hero (0), villain (1), or neither (2).
We can do this laterrr!

## Data cleaning

```{r}
# to get proper x and y coordinates

marvel_nodes$pos_x <- as.numeric(str_extract(marvel_nodes$X_pos, "-?\\d+\\.\\d+"))
marvel_nodes$pos_y <- as.numeric(str_extract_all(marvel_nodes$X_pos, "-?\\d+\\.\\d+") %>% sapply(`[`, 2))

# we don't need the X_pos anymore
marvel_nodes$X_pos <- NULL
```

### Renaming columns for better readability

```{r}

marvel_nodes <- marvel_nodes |> 
  rename(id = X..index,
         character_name = id,
         x = pos_x,
         y = pos_y)

marvel_links <- marvel_links |> 
  rename(source = X..source,
         target = target)
```

## Plot

```{r}
marvel_network <- graph_from_data_frame(d = marvel_links, vertices = marvel_nodes, directed = FALSE)

plot(marvel_network, vertex.label = V(marvel_network)$character_name, vertex.size = 5, edge.color = "gray")

```

Let's work on a cleaner plot, ideally I wanted to plot it with those characters that has the biggest sizes (number of partnerships) only, but I was not able to position the node labels clearly.
maybe we can try later.

For the font of use

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

font_import(pattern = "Marvel")  # Looks for "Marvel" in filenames
loadfonts()  # Registers the fonts with R

# Set font globally
par(family = "Marvel")

```

For the colours, we created a unique palette using the colours for the main Marvel superheroes:

Iron Man Red – #B40000

Captain America Blue – #0033A0

Hulk Green – #3C9A3F 

Thor Gold – #D6A400

Loki Purple – #6E0B75

![Marvel Colour Palette](marvel%20palette.png)

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# A consistent color schemes

# defining a color for each group - heroes '0', villains '1', and neither '2'

group_colors <- c("0" = "#B40000", "1" = "#0033A0", "2" = "#3C9A3F")

```

```{r warning=FALSE}
V(marvel_network)$group <- marvel_nodes$group

plot(marvel_network, 
     vertex.label = NA,                      
     vertex.size = 3,                        # node size
     edge.color = "gray15",                  # link line color
     vertex.color = group_colors[as.character(V(marvel_network)$group)],  # colors by group
     layout = cbind(V(marvel_network)$x, V(marvel_network)$y))  # for the coordinates

title("Marvel Partnerships Network", cex.main = 1.2)

# for the legend
legend("topleft", 
       legend = c("Heroes (0)", "Villains (1)", "Neither (2)"), 
       col = c("#B40000", "#0033A0", "#3C9A3F"), 
       pch = 16,  
       bty = "y")
```

```{r}
# plot with labels for the biggest nodes

# Calculate the degree of each node
degrees <- degree(marvel_network)

# Determine a threshold for "biggest" nodes, e.g., top 10%
threshold <- quantile(degrees, 0.98)

# Identify nodes with degree above the threshold
big_nodes <- V(marvel_network)[degrees > threshold]$character_name

# Plot the network with labels for the biggest nodes
plot(marvel_network,
     vertex.label = ifelse(degrees > threshold, V(marvel_network)$character_name, NA),
     vertex.size = degrees / max(degrees) * 10,  # Scale node size by degree
     edge.color = "gray15",
     vertex.color = group_colors[as.character(V(marvel_network)$group)],
     layout = cbind(V(marvel_network)$x, V(marvel_network)$y),
     vertex.label.family = "Marvel",
     vertex.label.cez = 0.5) # Adjust label size if needed

par(family = "Marvel")
title("Marvel Partnerships Network", cex.main = 1.2)

# Add legend
legend("topleft",
       legend = c("Heroes (0)", "Villains (1)", "Neither (2)"),
       col = c("lightblue", "tomato", "forestgreen"),
       pch = 16,
       bty = "y",
       cex = 0.8,  # Adjust legend text size if needed
       text.font = 2)   # Use bold font for legend text
```

**4. What is the number of nodes and links?**

The number of nodes for the Marvel network is 350, meaning that the network consists of 350 different Marvel characters (Heroes, Villains, and Neither).

The number of links (the number of partnerships amongst all characters) is 346.
This means that there are 346 different partnerships formed by the characters.

```{r}
# extracting number of nodes (characters) and links (partnerships)

num_nodes <- vcount(marvel_network)
num_links <- ecount(marvel_network)

# results
cat("Marvel Network Nodes:", num_nodes, "\nMarvel Network Links:", num_links, "\n")

# a simple plot

bp_nodes_links <- barplot(c(num_nodes, num_links), 
              names.arg = c("Nodes", "Links"), 
              main = "Marvel Network Size", 
              col = c("#7fcdbb", "#2c7fb8"),  
              ylim = c(0, max(num_nodes, num_links) * 1.3))  
text(bp_nodes_links, c(num_nodes, num_links) / 2,  
     labels = c(num_nodes, num_links), col = "white", cex = 1.2)
```

**5. What is the average degree in the network? And the standard deviation of the degree?**

We start with calculating the number of connections (links) for each node in the network.
The degree function helps us count the number of incoming and outgoing links.
This choice is due to the fact that the network is not a directed one (which means that connections go both ways, aka it takes two to tango).

Results show us that, on average, each Marvel character has about 2 (1.977143) partnerships.

As for the standard deviation, the number of partnerships per character typically differs from the average by 1.5 (1.54012).
This implies that some characters have more or fewer partnerships by 1.5, which tells us that the number does not vary wildly.

```{r}

# calculating degrees, average links and standard deviations

degrees <- degree(marvel_network, mode = "all")
avg_degree <- mean(degrees)
std_dev_degree <- sd(degrees)

# results
cat("Average degree:", avg_degree, "\nStandard deviation:", std_dev_degree, "\n")

```

**6. Plot the degree distribution in linear-linear scale and in log-log-scale. Does it have a typical connectivity? What is the degree of the most connected node?**

Linear-linear scale shows how many nodes have each degree on regular scales.
There is a sharp peak around the lower numbers of partnerships (1,2,3, and 4) with a long tail all the way towards 12, showing us the maximum number of partnerships possessed by a single character.
The right-skewed distribution implies an uneven distributiın of partnerships.
An interesting finding from this plot is that the number of characters with 4 partnerships is greater than that of characters with 3 partnerships.

The log-log plot of the degree distribution shows a scattered pattern, rather than a straight line, indicating that the network does not follow a power-law distribution typical of scale-free networks.
Instead, the degrees (1 to 12) suggest a more random or even connectivity pattern among the characters.
This also means that there are no dominant hubs.

```{r}
# we previously calculated the degrees for all nodes:

# print(degrees)

# distribution of partnership numbers (linear-linear)

degrees <- degree(marvel_network, mode = "all")
hist(degrees, main = "Degree Distribution", xlab = "Number of Partnerships", col = "#addd8e")

# log-log

plot(table(degrees), log = "xy", main = "Degree Distribution (Log-Log)", xlab = "Degree", ylab = "Frequency", pch = 16, col = "tomato")

max_degree <- max(degrees)

```

```{r}
# it looks a little nicer

# Plot histogram of degree distribution
ggplot(data.frame(degree = degrees), aes(x = degree)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#addd8e", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Degree Distribution", x = "Number of Partnerships", y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Marvel", size = 16))
```

**What is the clustering coefficient (transitivity) in the network?**

Transitivity measures how often nodes’ neighbors are also connected.
The transitivity value of 0.2194149 indicates that the network is more spread out than being tightly knit.

```{r}

clustering_coeff <- transitivity(marvel_network, type = "global")

#results
cat("Clustering coefficient:", clustering_coeff, "\n")

```

**7. What is the assortativity (degree) in the network?**

Assortativity measures if nodes with similar degrees connect (positive value) or if high-degree nodes connect to low-degree ones (negative value).
As explained earlier, we use 'directed = FALSE' because our network is bidirectional, meaning that a link (partnership) requires two parties.

The result (assortativity degree of -0.011047) shows that in the Marvel network, characters with high numbers of partnerships slightly tend to connect with those with fewer partnerships, but the effect is very weak (because it is very close to 0), almost random.

```{r}

assortativity_degree <- assortativity_degree(marvel_network, directed = FALSE)

# result  
cat("Assortativity (degree):", assortativity_degree, "\n")

```

Visually:

```{r}
# Calculate degrees
V(marvel_network)$degree <- degree(marvel_network)

# Plot using ggraph
ggraph(marvel_network, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree, color = degree), alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Assortativity Visualization", color = "Degree") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Marvel", size = 16))

```

**Using the Louvain method, does the network have a community structure?**

Yes.
The network shows a community structure, as indicated by the Louvain community detection plot where nodes are grouped into distinct color clusters, suggesting characters form groups with more connections within clusters than between them.

```{r}
set.seed(616)

# community detection using Louvain method
louvain_communities <- cluster_louvain(marvel_network)

# community membership for each node
V(marvel_network)$community <- membership(louvain_communities)

# network community plot
plot(marvel_network, 
     vertex.label = NA, 
     vertex.size = 3, 
     vertex.color = V(marvel_network)$community,
     layout = layout_with_fr(marvel_network),
     main = "Louvain Community Detection",
     fontfamily = "Marvel")

```

```{r}
# Plot community structure
set.seed(616)
louvain_communities <- cluster_louvain(marvel_network)
V(marvel_network)$community <- membership(louvain_communities)

ggplot(as_tbl_graph(marvel_network), aes(x = x, y = y, color = as.factor(community))) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = degree)) +
  geom_edge_link() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Community Detection", color = "Community") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(family = "Marvel", size = 16))


```

**If so, what is its modularity?**

Modularity score helps us decide to what extent the community structure demonstrates strong ties.

The modularity score of 0.92 (0.9116242), obtained using the Louvain community detection algorithm, indicates a very strong community structure in the Marvel network.
This suggests that characters tend to form highly interconnected groups with few connections between groups — likely reflecting narrative-based teams or story arcs within the Marvel universe.

Characters tend to form tight clusters, most partnerships occurring within those clusters, and there are fewer cross-cluster partnerships than you would expect by chance.

```{r}
set.seed(616)
# modularity value of the communities
modularity_value <- modularity(louvain_communities)

cat("Modularity of the Louvain community structure:", modularity_value, "\n")
```

**Test that the clustering coefficient in the network cannot be statistically explained by a configuration model in which the nodes have the same degree distribution as the original.**

After generating a degree-preserving rewired version of the Marvel network, we find that the clustering coefficient drops from 0.219 (the original Marvel network clustering coefficient) to 0.004 (the rewired graph clustering coefficient).
This significant decrease suggests that the clustering structure observed in the real network is not explained by the degree distribution alone.
Instead, it reflects meaningful group structures, such as narrative teams or recurring character associations in the Marvel universe.

The original Marvel network has much higher clustering than its degree-preserving random counterpart: characters that are connected to the same person tend to be connected to each other — suggesting intentional grouping or narrative structure (such as teams like Avengers or X-Men).

In the rewired version, where the number of connections for each character is preserved but partners are randomized, that natural tendency disappears.

```{r}
set.seed(616)

rewired_graph <- rewire(marvel_network, with = keeping_degseq(niter = ecount(marvel_network) * 10))

# the clustering coefficient for rewired version
rewired_transitivity <- transitivity(rewired_graph, type = "global")
cat("Clustering coefficient of rewired graph:", rewired_transitivity, "\n")
```

### Comparing the two networks

```{r}

data <- data.frame(Network = c("Original", "Rewired"), 
                   Clustering = c(clustering_coeff, rewired_transitivity))
ggplot(data, aes(x = Network, y = Clustering, fill = Network)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Clustering, 3)), vjust = -0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Original" = "#C6E2FF", "Rewired" = "#EEE685")) +
  labs(title = "Clustering Coefficient Comparison", y = "Clustering Coefficient") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Visualize the neighborhood of the node with the largest centrality (closeness)**

The neighbourhood of the node with the largest centrality belongs to Baron Zemo, a character which is not as popular and known as some others such as Spider-Man, Superman, and Captain America.

The reason why Baron Zemo appears as the node with the largest centrality is likely due to its strategic location.
Although the character has few partnerships (low degree), his centrality in the network makes him a strategic person, allowing him to reach out to many characters in shortest paths.
It is also very likely that he is close to the core of the network, which has short paths to other hubs in the network.

```{r}

# closeness centrality for each node
closeness_scores <- closeness(marvel_network, normalized = TRUE)

# the node with the highest closeness
max_closeness_node <- which.max(closeness_scores)

# the ego network (1-step neighborhood)
ego_net <- make_ego_graph(marvel_network, order = 1, nodes = max_closeness_node)[[1]]

# plot
plot(ego_net,
     vertex.label = V(ego_net)$character_name,
     vertex.size = 5,
     vertex.color = "gold",
     edge.color = "gray30",
     main = paste("Neighborhood of:", V(marvel_network)$character_name[max_closeness_node]))
```
